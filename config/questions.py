Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Data Engineer position. With two years of hands-on experience building cloud-native ETL pipelines, I bring proficiency in tools such as Apache Airflow, AWS, SQL, and Jenkins CI/CD, along with a strong focus on data quality and reliability.

At Eli Lilly, I led the migration of over 50 DAGs to Kubernetes-based Airflow environments, implemented 30+ Great Expectations suites for data validation, and optimized Jenkins pipelines‚Äîachieving a 20% gain in runtime efficiency and a 40% reduction in downstream data issues. My work has directly supported faster and more accurate analytics in clinical operations.

In addition to my technical skills, I‚Äôve collaborated closely with DBAs, analysts, and cross-functional teams to enhance schema design, build scalable data lakes, and improve governance through secure secret management and monitoring systems. I am currently expanding my knowledge in real-time data streaming using Apache Kafka and distributed computing frameworks like Spark.

I am excited about the opportunity to bring my engineering mindset, collaborative approach, and commitment to data excellence to your team. Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how I can contribute to your organization.

Sincerely,  
Kaustubh Upadhyaya
